Description of the project
--------------------------

this project aimed to practice the lexer and parser

===============


Sources
-------

Git repository: https://github.com/RudreshMishra/Ocaml_Compiler


===============

How to…
-------

…retrieve the sources?

  git clone https://github.com/RudreshMishra/Ocaml_Compiler

…compile?

  	ocamlc -c (name_of_file).ml

before compiling
	For lexer:

	ocamllex (name_of_lexer).mll

	For parser:

	menhir (name-_of_parser).mly


…execute and test?

  ocamlbuild main.byte -- TESTFILE.pfx

Structure of the project
------------------------

The project is organized as following:

Explain here the organization of your project, what is the use of each file or
group of files, etc.

You may also show the file tree as the following example:

Progress
--------

- We stopped at question 10.1  (proof of derivation)
- we tried to attempt the question 10.3 and 11.2
- There is still a bug in question 9.3, though we tried to implement it with full effort but due to confusion we couldnt progress
- we could finish the basic lexer with all the necessary prints

===============

Know bugs and issues
--------------------

- We were not able to manage question 10.3 completely due to lack of example statement

===============

Helpful resources
-----------------

- we used youtube channel for the parser and lexer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZ5lYLg6ARj4Wow3ZQXQzA
- book "Real World OCaml" by O'Reilly :-link: https://realworldocaml.org/ helped with the syntax
- …

===============

Difficulties
------------

- thinking functional.
- language is difficult to grasp compared to others.
- lack of pratical material on the same topic.
- lack of instant support if difficulties found.
